A digital portfolio is an electronic collection of your work, skills, experiences, and achievements. It's a dynamic and evolving representation of you, showcasing your best self to potential employers, clients, collaborators, or anyone interested in your capabilities.  Think of it as a modern, interactive resume and much more!
